pymauro is an open source library that wraps the REST API endpoints of a Mauro Data Mapper instance into a Python
library to allow easy, automated development.

Currently, documentation is lacking but the functionality can be approximately described by viewing the methods
as described in the documentation for the analogous client library at
https://maurodatamapper.github.io/resources/client/java/#binding-vs-non-binding-clients

Details on the endpoints themselves can be found at:
https://maurodatamapper.github.io/rest-api/introduction/#testing

Generally two branches should be available, master and development.
development is likely to contain more features but have poorer documentation.
